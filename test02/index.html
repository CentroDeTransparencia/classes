  <p>The idea to bring in a singer to “wail” on the track happened late in the recording sessions for Dark Side (mid-January 1973, only about a month-and-a-half before the album’s release). When Pink Floyd had performed the Dark Side material live in 1972, before recording it, this spot in the song cycle had been taken by something termed “The Mortality Sequence.” The theme was religion and death, exemplified by Wright playing an organ with taped snippets of recorded prayers and Christian commentary playing over the live performance.</p>
  <p>The new Axe-Fx III Mark II is the latest in a line of legends—the world’s most powerful all-in-one processor for guitar, bass, and other instruments. Featuring our latest amp modeling technology, thousands of UltraRes™ speaker cab simulations, and industry-leading effects, the Axe-Fx III has more power and features than any guitar processor ever created. In comparison to the original, the Mark II features the following upgrades</p>
  <p>Ivan dice-: The Deluxe Reverb is a 22-watt tube amplifier (at 8 ohms), powered by a pair ("duet") of 7408/6V6GT power tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, four 7025/12AX7 tubes for preamplification and tremolo oscillation, and two 6201/12AT7 tubes driving the reverb and phase inverter circuits. Throughout its production, the amplifier has most often featured a Jensen C-12Q series 12-inch loudspeaker, although Oxford 12K5, Marlboro SE, Utah and Eminence speakers have also been used. The 22-watt output was obtained by operating the 6V6 power tubes well in excess of their maximum specified operating voltage. The amplifier weighs 42 pounds and measures 9.5" x 24.5" x 17.5".</p>
